# SimpleLoginTemplatePython
Very simple login template with python

I made simple login template on python.

Project is made on "PyCharm", so there is .idea folder, but you may not think anything about it if you are using the code, just copy main.py

What modules did I use?

Well, I just used tkinter, I may edit this later, but this is so simple currently and it was the idea, I may make the window more better later on!

You are also free feel to use and edit my code!

Currently this just checks if the username and password is "admin" but you can edit them and if you want you can connect them to database and do what ever you want!
